# Project Fit America: Evaluating Fitness Outcomes in School-Based Interventions

This project analyzed the impact of Project Fit America’s school-based fitness programs on student performance across multiple physical fitness tests. The analysis was conducted in SPSS using paired and non-parametric testing methods to assess pre- and post-intervention changes.

## Objective

To evaluate whether the implementation of Project Fit America programs led to statistically significant improvements in student physical fitness, based on real-world data from elementary and middle schools.

## Tools Used

- IBM SPSS Statistics (Syntax and GUI)
- PDF reporting
- Excel (data formatting)

## Statistical Methods

- Paired t-tests (for normally distributed variables)
- Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (for non-normal data)
- Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality
- Descriptive statistics and percent change calculations

## Key Findings

- Most physical test categories (e.g., sit-ups, shuttle runs, pull-ups) showed statistically significant improvements after the intervention.
- Results were consistent across both genders and grade levels in most schools.
- The strongest gains were observed in cardiovascular endurance and upper body strength metrics.

## Repository Contents

- `/code/` – SPSS syntax files used to perform statistical tests
- `/data/` – (Optional) Sample anonymized or synthetic data if included
- `/report/` – Final project report (PDF) summarizing findings and methods

## Future Enhancements

- Recreate statistical workflow in R or Python for transparency and portability
- Add visualizations to support pre/post comparisons
- Integrate reproducible data pipeline
